The CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm is a simple and efficient method used to calculate trigonometric functions like sine and cosine. It's particularly useful because it only requires basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, bit shifts, and table lookups—no multiplication or division, which are more computationally expensive.

Here's a beginner-friendly explanation of how the CORDIC algorithm works:

Basic Idea
The CORDIC algorithm is based on the idea of rotating a vector in a plane to align it with the desired angle. As you rotate the vector step by step, you can calculate the sine and cosine of the angle you're rotating to. The algorithm works in iterative steps, each of which rotates the vector by a small angle that’s easy to compute.

Advantages of CORDIC
1. Efficient Computation: It only uses addition, subtraction, and bit-shifting, making it very efficient for hardware implementation (like in calculators, embedded systems, etc.).
2. No Need for Multiplication: Unlike other methods of computing sine and cosine, CORDIC doesn't require multiplication, which is computationally intensive.
3. Versatility: Besides sine and cosine, the CORDIC algorithm can be adapted to compute other functions, like hyperbolic functions, square roots, and logarithms.
